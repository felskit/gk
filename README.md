## Computer Graphics 1

### Project 1 - Polygon Editor

The task was to create a polygon editor that would feature a user interface allowing the user to create, delete and modify polygons on the screen. Certain edges of a polygon could also have some restrictions applied to them, such as being vertical/horizontal or of a given length at all times. That introduced a challenge to only allow modifications to the polygons which don't violate their restrictions.

### Project 2 - Polygon Editor v2.0

The task was to modify the editor created as a part of the first assignment and introduce other features such as various light effects, filling polygons with different colors or images and calculating new polygons which would be a union of selected polygon pairs. The light effects were:
* adding a heightmap to a polygon from a bitmap image,
* ability to move the light source and change its color,
* application of different normal vector functions to polygons.
All the light effects combined would result in various patterns and shadows showing up withing the polygons.

### Project 3 - Color Extractor

The task was to create an application that would have the ability to process an image by separating color layers in different color spaces, as well as provide a way to convert the image between them.

### Project 4 - 3D Racing Game

The final task was to create a more complex 3D game, where the main theme would be car racing. The game was supposed to feature advanced light effects, different lighting and shading models to choose from, as well as different predefined camera modes.
